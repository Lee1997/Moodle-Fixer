# Moodle Fixer
A little script I wrote to replace the module code of my university's notes-sharing website with the actual name of the module.

Finds a course, takes down the name of it, cleans it up and then replaces the text with the cleaned up version.

 Now also links to the modules exam papers so you don't have to spent 10 minutes navigating the university website to
find one set of exam papers.
